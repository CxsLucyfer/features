It's "devcontainer" or "devcontainers", not "Devcontainers". Devcontainers isn't
a proper noun. In fact, it's still in the process of being coelesced into a
single word! Microsoft (the author of the specification) use "dev containers".

On GitHub it is more popular to use "devcontainer" than it is to use "dev
container", so that's what we use.
