Answer these questions:
1. How do I get started with GitHub Codespaces?
2. How do I get started with VS Code Devcontainers?
3. What do I do after I have a running local instance?
4. How do I run tests locally?
5. How do I build the project locally?

Also need to run `prettier --write` on all this stuff
